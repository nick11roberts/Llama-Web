Llama-Web
=========

This is an HTML5 version of Llama for Android (https://github.com/nick11roberts/Llama). It populates the screen with llamas as the user presses the button on the screen using the qrand library for using truly random numbers generated from the Australian National University's quantum optics lab (their Quantum Random Number Generator).
